delete_dm_messages.py

This script is used to **automatically delete your own messages** from a private (DM) conversation with a specific user on Discord.

‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements:
- Your Discord user token (from browser or app)
- Your own Discord user ID
- The target user's Discord ID (the person you chatted with)

üìå Warning:
- Use this script at your own risk. Automating message deletion may go against Discord's Terms of Service.
- This script only deletes messages that you sent, not the other person's messages.
